<h2 class="text-center">Best Languages For Backend</h2>
<hr>
<p>Backend is the server-side of the website. It stores and arranges data, and also makes sure everything on the client-side of the website works fine. It is the part of the website that you cannot see and interact with. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. The parts and characteristics developed by backend designers are indirectly accessed by users through a front-end application.
 Activities, like writing APIs, creating libraries, and working with system components without user interfaces or even systems of scientific programming, are also included in the backend.</p>


<p>Back end Languages: The back end portion is built by using some languages which are discussed below: 
PHP: PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development. Since PHP code executed on the server-side, so it is called a server-side scripting language.
C++: It is a general-purpose programming language and widely used nowadays for competitive programming. It is also used as a backend language.
Java: Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages and platforms. It is highly scalable. Java components are easily available.
Python: Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.
JavaScript: JavaScript can be used as both (front end and back end) programming languages.
Node.js: Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser. You need to remember that NodeJS is not a framework, and it’s not a programming language. Most people are confused and understand it’s a framework or a programming language. We often use Node.js for building back-end services like APIs like Web App or Mobile App. It’s used in production by large companies such as Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Wallmart, and so on.</p>
